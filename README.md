# movefuns

The Move commons library for cross multi Move chain.

The goal of this library is to provide a common extension library for Move and to simplify the development of DApp SmartContracts on Move, like [apache-commons](https://commons.apache.org/) library on Java or [openzeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) on Solidity.

The library was deployed on the multi-Sign  address   ``` 0x6ee3f577c8da207830c31e1f0abb4244 ```
